SPTR-ItemConfig is a simple tool to edit item configuration files for the amazing mod [SPT Realism](https://github.com/space-commits/SPT-Realism-Mod-Server) created by space-commits. Go check it out if you have not already.

You MUST have Python installed in order to run this script. I have not yet worked out compiling it into an executable.

MUST BE RUN FROM THE TEMPLATES FOLDER!!! Directory will look something like this: "\SPTServer\user\mods\SPT-Realism-Mod-Server\db\templates"

The script searches the templates folder of the mod by ItemID [(I use this website as a reference library for those)](https://db.sp-tarkov.com/search) and presents a table of all editable values for you to change. It includes some neat tidbits, like the ability to see the orginal values and the current values while you are modifying them. It also maintains a list of which values you have modified in that instance.

This should make it much simpler to make small changes to items. I was inspired to make this because I wanted to raise the Loyalty Level requirement on some ammo types because I felt they were too easily accessible.
